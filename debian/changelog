mtp (0.0.1+13.10.20130926.3-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ St√©phane Graber ]
  * Fix upstart jobs. The system job was marked as task but wasn't a
    task and was therefore keeping lxc-android-config in post-start. The
    user job was working fine, but was backgrounding the process on the exec
    line instead of just letting upstart track it directly.

  [ Oliver Grawert ]
  * fix property handling so existing property settings are respected and mtp
    is only added/removed to/from the set
  * make sure we disable mtp on the usb gadget driver during shutdown so gvfsd
    on the host doesnt spill errors when the phone is rebooted because there is
    a mtp device but no server attached to it (LP: #1226825).
